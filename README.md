# oil-paintings
We are trying to create a model to differentiate human-created paintings from AI-generated paintings.
The styles of these images were transferred into different artistic styles of Monet, Van Gogh, Cezanne, and Ukiyo-e by using the CycleGAN model. The source code can be found at https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmgeneration
The train.py file was used to train a CNN model. 
The prediction.py file was used to predict whether images were created by humanor generated by AI.
